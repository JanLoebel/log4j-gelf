# GELF Appender for Apache Log4j (1.x)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JanLoebel/log4j-gelf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JanLoebel/log4j-gelf)

This appender for [Apache Log4j (1.x)](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.x/) logs messages to a GELF server like [Graylog2](http://www.graylog2.org) or [logstash](http://logstash.net).

It's using the official [GELF Java client](https://graylog2.github.io/gelfclient/) to connect to a remote server.


## Options
You can specify the following parameters for the GELF appender in the `log4j.xml` or `log4.properties` configuration file:

* `Facility` (default: ``)
  * The facility of the logger
* `Server` (default: `localhost`)
  * The host name or IP address of the GELF server
* `Port` (default: `12201`)
  * The port the GELF server is listening on
* `Protocol` (default: `UDP`)
  * The transport protocol to use (UDP or TCP)
* `QueueSize` (default: `512`)
  * The size of the internally used queue
* `TlsEnabled` (default: `false`)
  * Should the connection use TLS for transportation


## Usage
Add the `log4j-gelf` dependecy to your `pom.xml`:
```
	<dependency>
		<groupId>net.codeoftheday.log4j</groupId>
		<artifactId>log4j-gelf</artifactId>
		<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>
```

The following ``log4.properties` configuration will send all log messages with a log-level higher than `INFO` via `UDP` to `localhost` on port `12201`:
```
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, gelf

log4j.appender.gelf=net.codeoftheday.log4j.gelf.GelfAppender
log4j.appender.gelf.Facility=My Gelf Facility
log4j.appender.gelf.Host=localhost
log4j.appender.gelf.Port=12201
log4j.appender.gelf.Protocol=udp
log4j.appender.gelf.TlsEnabled=false
log4j.appender.gelf.QueueSize=512
```

## GELF-Message-Fields
Resulting GELF-Message fields will be:

* `message` (GELF-standard)
  * The log message
* `fullmessage` (GELF-standard)
  * The full log message
* `timestamp` (GELF-standard)
  * The timestamp of the log message
* `level` (GELF-standard)
  * The numeric value of the log level/severity
* `facility` (Optional)
  * The value of the configured `facility` field
* `loggerName`
  * The name of the logger which triggered the logging  
* `sourceMethodName`
  * The name of the method which triggered the logging
* `sourceLineNumber`
  * The line number of the line which triggered the logging
* `sourceClassName`
  * The class name of the class which triggered the logging
* `threadName`
  * The thread which triggered the logging
* `severity`
  * The severity of the triggered log level
* `time`
  * Timestamp formatted as `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ`
* `stackTrace` (Optional)
  * Stacktrace if there was an exception logged
* `{MDC-KEY}` (Optional)
  * All MDC key- and value-pairs will be added to the message
* `version`
  * Is the GELF-Version which is always 1.1

The project is based on [log4j2-gelf](https://github.com/Graylog2/log4j2-gelf).  

## Known limitations 
If you find any bug or if you have a feature-request, don't hesitate to use the [issue-tracker](https://github.com/JanLoebel/log4j-gelf/issues). **Push**-requests are always welcome.

* If your program ends before the [GELF Java client](https://graylog2.github.io/gelfclient/) has send the messages, these messages will be not be send.
